# _Hangman Game_
### _Hangman game contains pieces of JavaScript code that sets up a simple word game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. The code initializes the game, displays a hanging image to start with, a section to provide the user with potential incorrect guesses, gaps that should be filled by the user to guess the correct word, handles checking of user's answers, refreshing, and winning conditions. The user's thinking capacity as well as "guessing skills" are tested as the stickman will die if you have more incorrect guesses than correct ones_
